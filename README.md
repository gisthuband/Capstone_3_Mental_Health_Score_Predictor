Capstone 3 Project: Mental Health, Race, and Unemployment during Economic/Health Crisis, COVID-19

Mental health is paramount to the success of a society.  An economic/health crisis like COVID-19 threatened the mental health of all people in the US, however, due to systemic racism, different racial groups within the US are disparately impacted by crisis.  

By using a mental health score predictor, mental health predictions could be made for different racial groups within America based on unemployment statistics and racial group; this kind of information could be used to assess devastation and prepare mental health resources to soften the toll societally.
